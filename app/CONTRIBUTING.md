# Contributing to the FiftyOne App

This document describes best practices for contributing to the FiftyOne App
codebase.

## Introduction

This document will continue to evolve as we learn more about what works best.
It should be noted that this App was began as this
[boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate).

## Best Practices

-   All React components should be function-based, not class-based
-   We recommend writing fully typed TypeScript, although we are still
    transitioning
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used for autoformatting CSS,
    TypeScript, YAML, Markdown, etc. Installing FiftyOne with the development
    flag (`-d`) should have installed this step as a pre-commit hook

## Getting started

See the App [README.md](README.md) for installation instructions.

## Recommendations

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended front-end
development text editor. Configuring Prettier to autoformat on save in VS Code
is invaluable. See
[here](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-use-prettier-vscode).

## TODOS

-   ESLint configuration
-   Unit tests - see
    [here](https://www.learnstorybook.com/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/test/)
-   Recoil best practices
-   TSDoc documentation for non-component code?
