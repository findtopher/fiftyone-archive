This directory contains a suite of black box and ui integration tests.

**Black Box E2E Tests**

These are intended to simulate real users, and use little to no
fakes/mocks/etc.

**UI Integration Tests**

For the app, it will be useful to mock the backend for some tests. In order to
avoid duplicate setups, both suites will exist here.

**Running Locally**

-   Make sure `python` is available in path.
-   Run `yarn dev`.

**TODO**

This is a WIP and there a few things that need to be setup in order for its
initial version to be viable:

-   [x] initial setup cypress
-   [x] define tests approach (see below)
-   [x] verify approach works in a couple cases
-   [x] run python from cypress
-   [ ] setup on CI / github actions
-   [ ] modify install.bash to setup cypress for dev installs
-   [ ] update this readme once more fleshed out

**Approach**

See e2e/cypress/integration/quickstart/smoke.spec.ts
